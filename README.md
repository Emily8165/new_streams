HELLO AND WELCOME TO MY NEW PROJECT WHICH I AM CALLING NEW STREAMS!
Here is a little about the project:

Why do this?:
- Spotify, apple music and other streaming platforms are terrible for artists and listeners. 
- Artists are paid badly - Artists are currently not making what they should be because spotify and apple music are taking all the attention and not giving back to the artists.
- Relationships between listener
- Listeners data is not adiquitly protected and managed. 

What is the goal?:
1. I like music and I like artists and I want them to be paid fairly for their labour and art. 
2. I am not interested in making money on this project. I want to help people with this and not make money which is where I see the root of many evils lying. 
3. For me to learn better web app development and maintance.  

What does the app look like (ideally):
- Similer layout to other streaming platforms with a desktop and mobile app versions. 
- Users information is kept to a minimum and stored accordingly 
    - ideally the project's data it keeps on a user will look like this:
    UserName   |     UserId       | email | password | other data gathered whilst on app |
    users name |  UUID for users  | email | hash val | what they like to listen to, for how long, ect. 
    - essencially the users data that is gathered should only be gathered FOR THEM AND NOT FOR ADVERTISERS. 
- Artists are paid relivtive to the number of streams they get at fair rates and the number of people on the app. 
    - This will work similer to PRS, if you want your music to be streamable and discoverable. you need to pay your union dues via standing order each year. 
      if the artist doesn't pay this then their tracks are deactivated until they pay. 
    - An artist will make money based on how many listeners they have based on publicly disclosed payscales. But each will recieve enough to allow them to continue their art. 
- Availbily for artists to look at their stats/see people reactions
    - this will be to enhance listener/artist interaction. 
    - as apposed to just hearing the song, listeners will get to experiance it, think of this like putting lyrics on a vynal or an explaination book with a CD. 

Technical understanding:
- My background is in python specifically django as a backend dev. I feel this will be a good way for me to develop these skills further whilst learning front end peices as well. 

I am bored of writing this now and I think it lays out the jist so far. I will update wiht tech drawings/designs/thoughts once I have a better idea of how to lay this all out.
